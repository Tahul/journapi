## 💻 The stack

This project was an opportunity for me to discover the [TALL Stack](https://tallstack.dev/).

This project is so composed of:
- [Laravel 7](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x)
- [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/quickstart)
- [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I recommend you to refer to these libraries / frameworks documentations.

The setup instructions are described on the Laravel documentation.
